AI-EBD Assistant is an intelligent research assistant designed to help researchers generate high-quality research questions based on the Environment-Based Design (EBD) methodology (with link: https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/proceedings/IDETC-CIE2011/54860/237/354151). This tool leverages GPT-4 and LangChain to enhance academic research efficiency by:
âœ… Generating Research Questions (RQs): Based on user-input project topics, AI-EBD formulates research questions following EBD principles (Environment Analysis, Conflict Identification, Solution Generation).
âœ… Providing AI-Powered Answers: The system utilizes GPT-4 to generate insightful responses to the research questions.
âœ… Recommending Relevant Research Papers: AI generates precise search keywords and retrieves strongly related academic papers from sources like Google Scholar and Semantic Scholar.

Key Features
ðŸ”¹ EBD-Driven Research Question Generation â€“ Ensures that research questions align with the EBD methodology.
ðŸ”¹ AI-Powered Question Answering â€“ Uses GPT-4 to provide detailed responses.
ðŸ”¹ Automated Keyword Extraction â€“ Enhances literature search efficiency with high-precision search queries.
ðŸ”¹ Research Paper Recommendation â€“ Uses web search APIs to retrieve strongly relevant academic papers.
ðŸ”¹ User-Friendly Web Interface â€“ Built with Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive research experience.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, LangChain, GPT-4, FAISS (Vector Database)
Frontend: Streamlit (Web Interface)
Data Retrieval: DuckDuckGo API, Google Scholar Scraper
Deployment: Docker, Cloud Hosting
Use Cases
ðŸ”¸ Academic Research: Quickly generate research questions for thesis/dissertation work.
ðŸ”¸ Project Planning: Use AI-driven insights to refine project objectives.
ðŸ”¸ Literature Review: Get relevant academic sources in a fraction of the time.
